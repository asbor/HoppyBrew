## Overview
- Audited repo post-migration; identified critical backend issues (broken PostgreSQL DSN, invalid ORM relationships, unsafe session handling) and documented them in review notes.
- Authored `TODO.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `AI_AGENT_MANIFEST.md` to guide future multi-agent collaboration.
- Refreshed README and setup guide links; added usage instructions and multi-agent guidance.
- Bootstrapped `documents/status/` for ongoing coordinator logs.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Fix database configuration and connection retry logic (`services/backend/database.py`).
- [ ] Align batch relationships and complete endpoint tests (`services/backend/api/endpoints/batches.py`, `services/backend/tests/test_endpoints/test_batches.py`).
- [ ] Replace placeholder `users` endpoint with real auth skeleton or explicit stub (`services/backend/api/endpoints/users.py`).
- [ ] Decide on scraping approach and cleanup legacy modules (`services/backend/modules/*.py`, `services/backend/scraper.py`).
- [ ] Establish CI workflow for tests/linting.

## Questions / Blockers
- Need confirmation on desired auth scope (local accounts vs. third-party) before implementing users module.
- Clarify preferred approach for beer style ingestion (requests vs. Selenium) to avoid redundant maintenance.
