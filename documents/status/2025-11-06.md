# 2025-11-06

## Overview
- Created feature branches (`feature/database-optimization`, `feature/frontend-components`, `feature/testing-strategy`, `feature/workspace-cleanup`) to isolate agent workstreams.
- Added tracking issues under `documents/issues/` tying TODO priorities to agent scope for GitHub parity.
- Published `.github/COMMIT_TEMPLATE.txt` and noted configuration so all contributors share the same commit format.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Define branch protection policy and enumerate required status checks with the Testing Agent.
- [ ] Coordinate with Workspace Agent on long-term home for issue docs and commit conventions.
- [ ] Draft PR review checklist and merge process for inclusion in CODEX agent docs.

## Questions / Blockers
- Awaiting clarity on CI workflow availability to wire into branch protections.
- Need confirmation on who owns contributor guide updates (Workspace vs Documentation agents).
